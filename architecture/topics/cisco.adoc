The Cisco ACI CNI plug-in for {product-title} provides integration between the Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (Cisco APIC) controller and one or more {product-title} clusters connected to a Cisco ACI fabric.

This integration is implemented across two main functional areas:

. The Cisco ACI CNI plug-in extends the ACI fabric capabilities to {product-title} clusters in order to provide IP address management, networking, load balancing, and security functions for {product-title} workloads. The Cisco ACI CNI plug-in connects all {product-title} Pods to the integrated VXLAN overlay provided by Cisco ACI.

. The Cisco ACI CNI plug-in models the entire {product-title} cluster as a VMM domain on the Cisco APIC. This provides APIC with access to the inventory of resources of the {product-title} cluster, including the number of {product-title} nodes, {product-title} namespaces, services, deployments, Pods, their IP and MAC addresses, interfaces they are using, and so on. APIC uses this information to automatically correlate physical and virtual resources in order to simplify operations.

The Cisco ACI CNI plug-in is designed to be transparent for {product-title} developers and administrators and to integrate seamlessly from an operational standpoint.
