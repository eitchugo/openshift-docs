{product-title} Monitoring ships with a Prometheus instance for cluster monitoring and a central Alertmanager cluster. In addition to Prometheus and Alertmanager, {product-title} Monitoring also includes a link:https://grafana.com/[Grafana] instance as well as pre-built dashboards for cluster monitoring troubleshooting. The Grafana instance that is provided with the monitoring stack, along with its dashboards, is read-only.

To get the addresses for accessing Prometheus, Alertmanager, and Grafana web UIs:

.Procedure

. Run the following command:
+
----
$ oc -n openshift-monitoring get routes
NAME                HOST/PORT
alertmanager-main   alertmanager-main-openshift-monitoring.apps._url_.openshift.com
grafana             grafana-openshift-monitoring.apps._url_.openshift.com
prometheus-k8s      prometheus-k8s-openshift-monitoring.apps._url_.openshift.com
----
+
Make sure to prepend `https://` to these addresses. You cannot access web UIs using unencrypted connections.

. Authentication is performed against the {product-title} identity and uses the same credentials or means of authentication as is used elsewhere in {product-title}. You must use a role that has read access to all namespaces, such as the `cluster-monitoring-view` cluster role.
